## What is SEC EDGAR?

EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's primary system for companies to submit official filings. It serves as the central repository for corporate financial information and "increases the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of the securities markets" by providing free public access to this data.

## XBRL: The Data Standard

### What is XBRL?

XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) is a standardized format for business and financial data that makes information machine-readable and comparable across companies.

<Tip>
  SEC Edgar MCP performs direct XBRL parsing to extract financial data with exact precision, maintaining the numeric accuracy as filed with the SEC.
</Tip>

### XBRL Namespaces

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="US-GAAP" icon="flag-usa">
    **US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles**
    
    Standard concepts like:
    - `us-gaap:Assets`
    - `us-gaap:Revenues`
    - `us-gaap:NetIncomeLoss`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Company-Specific" icon="building">
    **Company Extensions**
    
    Custom concepts for unique items:
    - `aapl:iPhoneRevenue`
    - `tsla:AutomotiveSales`
    - `msft:ProductivityRevenue`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### XBRL Structure

```xml
<ix:nonFraction contextRef="Q32023" name="us-gaap:Revenues" unitRef="USD" 
                decimals="-6" scale="6">29900</ix:nonFraction>
```

**Components**:
- **Context**: Time period and entity information
- **Concept**: What is being measured (e.g., Revenue)
- **Unit**: Measurement unit (USD, shares, etc.)
- **Value**: The actual reported value
- **Scale**: Multiplication factor (scale="6" means multiply by 1,000,000)

## Data Quality and Precision

### SEC Edgar MCP's Approach

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Direct Parsing" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Extracts data directly from XBRL using regex patterns, not API approximations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exact Precision" icon="calculator">
    Maintains exact numeric precision with proper scale factors applied
  </Card>
  <Card title="Source Attribution" icon="link">
    Every response includes SEC URLs for independent verification
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Data Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scale Factors">
    **Problem**: XBRL values often use scale factors (e.g., scale="6" for millions)
    
    **SEC Edgar MCP Solution**: Automatically applies scale factors to provide actual values
    
    **Example**: 
    - XBRL value: 29900 with scale="6"  
    - Actual value: 29,900,000,000 (29.9 billion)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context Periods">
    **Problem**: Same concept can have multiple values for different periods
    
    **SEC Edgar MCP Solution**: Provides period context and selects most recent values by default
    
    **Example**: Revenue for Q1, Q2, Q3, and annual periods all in same filing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Company Extensions">
    **Problem**: Companies create custom XBRL concepts not in standard taxonomies
    
    **SEC Edgar MCP Solution**: Discovers and extracts both standard and company-specific concepts
    
    **Example**: Apple's iPhone-specific revenue breakdowns
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
