## Overview

SEC Edgar MCP is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI models to the rich dataset of [SEC EDGAR filings](https://www.sec.gov/edgar). EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) is the U.S. SEC's primary system for companies to submit official filings, containing millions of filings that increase the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of securities markets.
